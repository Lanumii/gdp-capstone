# GDP Project

## Introduction
As an analyst at Mysellar, a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of stores - online and offline - on all continents. The items sold cut across a range of categories including cosmetics, baby food, household, office supplies, and clothes.

## Objectives
- What is the total yearly profit for each sales channel - online and offline?
- Show the total units sold per region.
- Have the sales of any category of the product increased or decreased over time?
- Show the monthly trend of sales and profit in 2021. What are the top-performing regions in terms of revenue and profits?
- What is the average shipping time (days) and which region has the lowest average number of days it takes to ship orders?
- What are the top 5 and bottom 5 countries by order volumes?
- An executive is postulating that Mysellar should be generating more sales in countries with higher economic productivity. For countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, is there a correlation between total sales and GDP? Highlight countries of interest in your report.
